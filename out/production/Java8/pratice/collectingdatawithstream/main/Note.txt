The main advantage of functional style over the imperative style : you have to formulate the result you want to obtain
the "what" and not the step  you need to perform to obtain it - the "how".

Collector are extremely useful because they provide a concise  yet flexible way to define  the criteria  that collect uses to
produce the resulting collection.


Predefined collectors:

    1. Reducing and summarizing streams elements to a single value.
    2. Grouping elements.
    3. Partitioning elements.



collectors(the parameter to the stream method collect) are typicaly used in case where it's necessary to reorganize the
streams items into a collections But more generally , they can be used every time you want to combine all the items into
the stream into a single result.


The collector returned by joining factory method concatenates into a single string all String
resulting from invoking the toString method on each Object in stream.

Note that joining internally make use of StringBuilder  to append the generated String  into one.




Collectors.reduce factory method is a generalized way of reducing the stream.
